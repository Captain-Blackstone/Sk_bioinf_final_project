 -> TauE
Sulfite exporter TauE/SafE; This is a family of integral membrane proteins where the alignment appears to contain two duplicated modules of three transmembrane helices. The proteins are involved in the transport of anions across the cytoplasmic membrane during taurine metabolism as an exporter of sulfoacetate. This family used to be known as DUF81.

 -> DUF4870
Domain of unknown function (DUF4870); Domain of unknown function (DUF4870).  

GFKBJCAA_00005
 -> PEP_TPR_lipo superfamily
putative PEP-CTERM system TPR-repeat lipoprotein; This protein family occurs in strictly within a subset of Gram-negative bacterial species with the proposed PEP-CTERM/exosortase system, analogous to the LPXTG/sortase system common in Gram-positive bacteria. This protein occurs in a species if and only if a transmembrane histidine kinase (TIGR02916) and a DNA-binding response regulator (TIGR02915) also occur. The present of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) suggests protein-protein interaction, possibly for the regulation of PEP-CTERM protein expression, since many PEP-CTERM proteins in these genomes are preceded by a proposed DNA binding site for the response regulator. 
 -> PRK11447 superfamily
cellulose synthase subunit BcsC; Provisional

GFKBJCAA_00015
 -> Dabb
Stress responsive A/B Barrel Domain; The function of this domain is unknown, but it is upregulated in response to salt stress in Populus balsamifera (balsam poplar). It is also found at the C-terminus of a fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase from Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus.It is found in the pA01 plasmid, which encodes genes for molybdopterin uptake and degradation of plant alkaloid nicotine. The structure of one has been solved and the domain forms an alpha-beta barrel dimer. Although there is a clear duplication within the domain it is not obviously detectable in the sequence.

GFKBJCAA_00020
 -> S2P-M50_like_1
Uncharacterized homologs of Site-2 protease (S2P), zinc metalloproteases (MEROPS family M50) which cleave transmembrane domains of substrate proteins, regulating intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of diverse signal transduction mechanisms. Members of the S2P/M50 family of RIP proteases use proteolytic activity within the membrane to transfer information across membranes to integrate gene expression with physiologic stresses occurring in another cellular compartment. In eukaryotic cells they regulate such processes as sterol and lipid metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses. In prokaryotes they regulate such processes as sporulation, cell division, stress response, and cell differentiation. This group includes bacterial, eukaryotic, and Archaeal S2P/M50s homologs with a minimal core protein and no PDZ domains.

GFKBJCAA_00023
 -> EEP superfamily
Exonuclease-Endonuclease-Phosphatase (EEP) domain superfamily; This large superfamily includes the catalytic domain (exonuclease/endonuclease/phosphatase or EEP domain) of a diverse set of proteins including the ExoIII family of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases, inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (INPP5), neutral sphingomyelinases (nSMases), deadenylases (such as the vertebrate circadian-clock regulated nocturnin), bacterial cytolethal distending toxin B (CdtB), deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNase1), the endonuclease domain of the non-LTR retrotransposon LINE-1, and related domains. These diverse enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism of cleaving phosphodiester bonds; their substrates range from nucleic acids to phospholipids and perhaps proteins.

GFKBJCAA_00024
 -> nfrB superfamily
phage adsorption protein NrfB; phage adsorption protein NrfB.  

GFKBJCAA_00030
 -> DUF1444 superfamily
Protein of unknown function (DUF1444); This family contains several hypothetical bacterial proteins of unknown function that are approximately 250 residues long.

GFKBJCAA_00031
 -> Abhydrolase superfamily
alpha/beta hydrolases; A functionally diverse superfamily containing proteases, lipases, peroxidases, esterases, epoxide hydrolases and dehalogenases. The catalytic apparatus typically involves three residues (catalytic triad): a serine, a glutamate or aspartate and a histidine, and often the mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl carbon atom.

GFKBJCAA_00032
 -> metallo-dependent_hydrolases superfamily
Superfamily of metallo-dependent hydrolases (also called amidohydrolase superfamily) is a large group of proteins that show conservation in their 3-dimensional fold (TIM barrel) and in details of their active site. The vast majority of the members have a conserved metal binding site, involving four histidines and one aspartic acid residue. In the common reaction mechanism, the metal ion (or ions) deprotonate a water molecule for a nucleophilic attack on the substrate. The family includes urease alpha, adenosine deaminase, phosphotriesterase  dihydroorotases, allantoinases, hydantoinases, AMP-, adenine and cytosine deaminases, imidazolonepropionase, aryldialkylphosphatase, chlorohydrolases, formylmethanofuran dehydrogenases and others.

GFKBJCAA_00036
 -> TS_Pyrimidine_HMase superfamily
Thymidylate synthase and pyrimidine hydroxymethylase: Thymidylate synthase (TS) and deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase (dCMP-HMase) are homologs that catalyze analogous alkylation of C5 of pyrimidine nucleotides. Both enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of DNA precursors and are active as homodimers. However, they exhibit distinct pyrimidine base specificities and differ in the details of their catalyzed reactions. TS is biologically ubiquitous and catalyzes the conversion of dUMP and methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) to dTMP and dihydrofolate (DHF). It also acts as a regulator of its own expression by binding and inactivating its own RNA. Due to its key role in the de novo pathway for thymidylate synthesis and, hence, DNA synthesis, it is one of the most conserved enzymes across species and phyla. TS is a well-recognized target for anticancer chemotherapy, as well as a valuable new target against infectious diseases. Interestingly, in several protozoa, a single polypeptide chain codes for both, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS), forming a bifunctional enzyme (DHFR-TS), possibly through gene fusion at a single evolutionary point. DHFR-TS is also active as a dimer. Virus encoded dCMP-HMase catalyzes the reversible conversion of dCMP and CH2THF to hydroxymethyl-dCMP and THF. This family also includes dUMP hydroxymethylase, which is encoded by several bacteriophages that infect Bacillus subtilis, for their own protection against the host restriction system,  and contain hydroxymethyl-dUMP instead of dTMP in their DNA.
