Q#2 - >GFKBJCAA_00002 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase[2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase]	superfamily	386096	16	118	5.13702e-10	57.0712	cl11394	Glyco_tranf_GTA_type superfamily	C	 - 	Glycosyltransferase family A (GT-A) includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold; Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are enzymes that synthesize oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates by transferring the sugar moiety from an activated nucleotide-sugar donor to an acceptor molecule, which may be a growing oligosaccharide, a lipid, or a protein.  Based on the stereochemistry of the donor and acceptor molecules, GTs are classified as either retaining or inverting enzymes. To date, all GT structures adopt one of two possible folds, termed GT-A fold and GT-B fold.  This hierarchy includes diverse families of glycosyl transferases with a common GT-A type structural fold, which has two tightly associated beta/alpha/beta domains that tend to form a continuous central sheet of at least eight beta-strands. The majority of the proteins in this superfamily are Glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT-2) proteins. But it also includes families GT-43, GT-6, GT-8, GT13 and GT-7; which are evolutionarily related to GT-2 and share structure similarities.

Q#5 - >GFKBJCAA_00005 hypothetical protein[hypothetical protein]	superfamily	274350	332	408	1.22338e-06	50.8524	cl37187	PEP_TPR_lipo superfamily	N	 - 	putative PEP-CTERM system TPR-repeat lipoprotein; This protein family occurs in strictly within a subset of Gram-negative bacterial species with the proposed PEP-CTERM/exosortase system, analogous to the LPXTG/sortase system common in Gram-positive bacteria. This protein occurs in a species if and only if a transmembrane histidine kinase (TIGR02916) and a DNA-binding response regulator (TIGR02915) also occur. The present of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) suggests protein-protein interaction, possibly for the regulation of PEP-CTERM protein expression, since many PEP-CTERM proteins in these genomes are preceded by a proposed DNA binding site for the response regulator.

Q#10 - >GFKBJCAA_00010 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 2[3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 2]	specific	274452	4	411	0	723.119	TIGR03150	fabF	 - 	cl09938	beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase II; 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 2 (KAS-II, FabF) is involved in the condensation step of fatty acid biosynthesis in which the malonyl donor group is decarboxylated and the resulting carbanion used to attack and extend the acyl group attached to the acyl carrier protein. Most genomes encoding fatty acid biosynthesis contain a number of condensing enzymes, often of all three types: 1, 2 and 3. Synthase 2 is mechanistically related to synthase 1 (KAS-I, FabB) containing a number of absolutely conserved catalytic residues in common. This model is based primarily on genes which are found in apparent operons with other essential genes of fatty acid biosynthesis (GenProp0681). The large gap between the trusted cutoff and the noise cutoff contains many genes which are not found adjacent to genes of the fatty acid pathway in genomes that often also contain a better hit to this model. These genes may be involved in other processes such as polyketide biosyntheses. Some genomes contain more than one above-trusted hit to this model which may result from recent paralogous expansions. Second hits to this model which are not next to other fatty acid biosynthesis genes may be involved in other processes. FabB sequences should fall well below the noise cutoff of this model.

Members of the S2P/M50 family of RIP proteases use proteolytic activity within the membrane to transfer information across membranes to integrate gene expression with physiologic stresses occurring in another cellular compartment. In eukaryotic cells they regulate such processes as sterol and lipid metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses. In prokaryotes they regulate such processes as sporulation, cell division, stress response, and cell differentiation. This group includes bacterial, eukaryotic, and Archaeal S2P/M50s homologs with a minimal core protein and no PDZ domains.

C55-isoprenyl (undecaprenyl) pyroposphate acts as a scaffold for the assembly of peptidoglycan components; undecaprenol kinase (UDPK) is involved in recycling undecaprenyl units for re-use in the peptidoglycan biosynthesis. UDPK does not participate in the de-novo biosynthesis of undecaprenyl phosphate. Gram-positive bacteria have a large pool of free undecaprenol, in contrast to gram-negative bacteria. UDPK may also play a role in a stress-induced pathway that affects the function of ribosomes. In Streptococcus mutans, UDPK has been shown to be required for biofilm formation, such as in the case of smooth surface dental caries. Members of the UDPK family have low activity as diacylglycerol kinases (DAGK), and many of them are annotated as DAGKs.

Q#26 - >GFKBJCAA_00026 Branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase[Branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase]	superfamily	381876	1	284	1.3763e-179	495.93	cl00224	PLPDE_IV superfamily	 - 	 - 	PyridoxaL 5'-Phosphate Dependent Enzymes class IV (PLPDE_IV). This D-amino acid superfamily, one of five classes of PLPDE, consists of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferases (BCAT), D-amino acid transferases (DAAT), and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyases (ADCL). BCAT catalyzes the reversible transamination reaction between the L-branched-chain amino and alpha-keto acids. DAAT catalyzes the synthesis of D-glutamic acid and D-alanine, and ADCL converts 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate to p-aminobenzoate and pyruvate. Except for a few enzymes, i. e.,  Escherichia coli and Salmonella BCATs, which are homohexamers arranged as a double trimer, the class IV PLPDEs are homodimers. Homodimer formation is required for catalytic activity.

The catalytic apparatus typically involves three residues (catalytic triad): a serine, a glutamate or aspartate and a histidine, and often the mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl carbon atom.
Q#32 - >GFKBJCAA_00032 hypothetical protein[hypothetical protein]	superfamily	381920	1	301	3.60297e-18	82.8621	cl00281	metallo-dependent_hydrolases superfamily	 - 	 - 	Superfamily of metallo-dependent hydrolases (also called amidohydrolase superfamily) is a large group of proteins that show conservation in their 3-dimensional fold (TIM barrel) and in details of their active site. The vast majority of the members have a conserved metal binding site, involving four histidines and one aspartic acid residue. In the common reaction mechanism, the metal ion (or ions) deprotonate a water molecule for a nucleophilic attack on the substrate. The family includes urease alpha, adenosine deaminase, phosphotriesterase  dihydroorotases, allantoinases, hydantoinases, AMP-, adenine and cytosine deaminases, imidazolonepropionase, aryldialkylphosphatase, chlorohydrolases, formylmethanofuran dehydrogenases and others.

Some uncharacterized homologous sequences are also included in this subfamily. The prototypical member of this subfamily is Escherichia coli RhuK, which exists as a monomer composed of two large domains. The ATP binding site is located in the cleft between the two domains. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain. The presence of divalent Mg2+ or Mn2+ is required for catalysis. Although an intramolecular disulfide bridge is present in Rhuk, disulfide formation is not important to the regulation of RhuK enzymatic activity. Members of this subfamily belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases.
Q#36 - >GFKBJCAA_00036 hypothetical protein[hypothetical protein]	superfamily	388507	117	194	0.00584757	37.0501	cl19097	TS_Pyrimidine_HMase superfamily	NC	 - 	Thymidylate synthase and pyrimidine hydroxymethylase: Thymidylate synthase (TS) and deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase (dCMP-HMase) are homologs that catalyze analogous alkylation of C5 of pyrimidine nucleotides. Both enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of DNA precursors and are active as homodimers. However, they exhibit distinct pyrimidine base specificities and differ in the details of their catalyzed reactions. TS is biologically ubiquitous and catalyzes the conversion of dUMP and methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) to dTMP and dihydrofolate (DHF). It also acts as a regulator of its own expression by binding and inactivating its own RNA. Due to its key role in the de novo pathway for thymidylate synthesis and, hence, DNA synthesis, it is one of the most conserved enzymes across species and phyla. TS is a well-recognized target for anticancer chemotherapy, as well as a valuable new target against infectious diseases. Interestingly, in several protozoa, a single polypeptide chain codes for both, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS), forming a bifunctional enzyme (DHFR-TS), possibly through gene fusion at a single evolutionary point. DHFR-TS is also active as a dimer. Virus encoded dCMP-HMase catalyzes the reversible conversion of dCMP and CH2THF to hydroxymethyl-dCMP and THF. This family also includes dUMP hydroxymethylase, which is encoded by several bacteriophages that infect Bacillus subtilis, for their own protection against the host restriction system,  and contain hydroxymethyl-dUMP instead of dTMP in their DNA.
